<H2 id="Purpose">Purpose of this account</H2>
<p>This is an account to test bookmarks and compatibility of Mozilla Firefox and SNU. It is a personal alt of Sean (the creator of SNU) and currently acts as bookmark history</p>
<H1>=============================================================</H1>
<img src="BOOKMARKICON1.png" alt="BMK" width="100" height="100">
<H2 id="BookmarkInfo">Bookmark info</H2>
<p>On March 8th 2019, Sean decided to start harvesting metadata from Firefox bookmarks and keep it even more organized. Originally, there used to be several tabs open at once (up to 35) and this was causing issues, even with Firefox. So sean organized it into one folder.</p>
<p>Soon after, that expanded, and went to future downloads, to web tools, to unique websites, references, documentation and more</p>
<p>That is the info on the bookmarks!</p>
<H2>Limits</H2>
<p>A limit was discovered in the morning of March 11th 2019. There is a limit on how many dividers you can have. Hopefully that isn't the same for folders and bookmarks</p>
<H2>Edit: March 15th 2019 at 11:27 am - Almost forgot to update this, the bookmark and divider adding options have been working perfectly since, and there is no issue anymore. It was because I accidentally clicked on a sorting option which greyed out dividers.</H2>

<H1>=============================================================</H1>
<H1 id="LinkRot">⛓Link rot⛓</H1>
<p>Sean has gone along and bookmarked thousands of web pages. Why? At first, it turned out to be a organization technique for future downloads, but then it spread to testing Mozilla Firefox, then making a big reference library.</p>
<p>However, when you have thousands of links, some of them may not last as long as SNU</p>
<p>The majority of the links seem like they would last a long time, but there are unfortunately no gurantees.</p>
<p>Sean expects sites like archive.org, wikipedia.org, and khan academy to thrive, but he doesn't have as high of hopes for other links.</p>
<p>It would be a waste of time if the links were to just disappear. These links seem like they would last though.</p>
<p>If you spot link rot (when a link doesn't work anymore as the page is no longer there) unfortunately, it may not be coming back. Even if it does, it may not be the same.</p>

<H1 id="ExplainingMyStupidSearches">Explaining my stupid searches</H1>
<H2>Random searches</H2>
<p>There are some random searches, you can see spammed letters. Sometimes when I get bored, I mess around with Google searches. Sometimes they actually work and give unique results. That is why those specific tabs are bookmarked. The one that says boooooooooooooooooooop was bookmarked, because there were unique foreign results for that such as a facebook account from China, memes, and more. The ones with lots of random letters actually somehow worked. The internet is almost complete if we can just spam random characters and get a decent amount of results. That is why that was bookmarked. The results were unexpected.</p>
<p>"How to eat pimples" was something weird I bookmarked a while ago, thinking it was funny. However, I was out of it, as that is not funny and comes off as really weird. Just another random search.</p>
<H2>Subreddits on reddit</H2>
<p>I spend time on reddit when I get bored. And sometimes I explore to weird places.</p>
<p>Here are some examples:</p>
<p><b>r/BuffNakedKevinJames</b> This was a random subreddit I found when going through comments. The name was so ridiculous that I just decided to Subscribe to it, even though not much will come out of it.</p>
<p><b>r/aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</b> This subreddit is kind of pointless after you read it for a long time. All it is is spamming the letter A. It can be comedic and entertainining in an odd way, and sometimes is good to check back on, see how it's doing.</p>
<p><b>r/aaaaaaa</b>Same as above, just less A's.</p>
<p>That is pretty much it for reddit. Reddit is a pretty cool place</p>

<H1>=============================================================</H1>
<H1 id="TheDownloadWait">The download wait</H1>
<p>I have a lot of stuff from archive.org bookmarked that I want to download and test in the future. However, I have to wait a long time for multiple reasons:</p>
<p>Some downloads aren't abandonware yet, and I can't get them as that would be illegal. So in 2017, I would be able to freely download Windows Vista for free, since it is abandonware, and Microsoft no longer supports it, and I would have to wait until 2023 for Windows 7 to go out of support.</p>
<p>Another reason is the file size is huge compared to the storage system I have now.</p>
<H2>| Sean Patrick Myrick on March 17th 2019 at 12:49 pm |</H2>
<H1>=============================================================</H1>
<H1 id="ExplainingLinks">Explaining links</H1>
<H2>Reddit</H2>
<p>Some reddit links have custom titles and they are bad without context at times. Check the URL and not just the title.</p>
<H2>Other</H2>
<p>No other explanation needed at the moment of this snapshot</p>
