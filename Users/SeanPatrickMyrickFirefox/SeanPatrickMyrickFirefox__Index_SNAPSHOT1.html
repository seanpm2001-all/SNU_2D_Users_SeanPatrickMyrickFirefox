<H2>Purpose of this account</H2>
<p>This is an account to test bookmarks and compatibility of Mozilla Firefox and SNU. It is a personal alt of Sean (the creator of SNU) and currently acts as bookmark history</p>

<H2>Bookmark info</H2>
<p>On March 8th 2019, Sean decided to start harvesting metadata from Firefox bookmarks and keep it even more organized. Originally, there used to be several tabs open at once (up to 35) and this was causing issues, even with Firefox. So sean organized it into one folder.</p>
<p>Soon after, that expanded, and went to future downloads, to web tools, to unique websites, references, documentation and more</p>
<p>There are some random searches, you can see spammed letters. Sometimes when I get bored, I mess around with Google searches. Sometimes they actually work and give unique results. That is why those specific tabs are bookmarked. The one that says boooooooooooooooooooop was bookmarked, because there were unique foreign results for that such as a facebook account from China, memes, and more. The ones with lots of random letters actually somehow worked. The internet is almost complete if we can just spam random characters and get a decent amount of results. That is why that was bookmarked. The results were unexpected.</p>
<p>That is the info on the bookmarks!</p>
